In the ASExtras example, the package website has the appropriate links for the files: https://mmade.org/asextras4/\nOnce you have downloaded the file, you need to select it for installation. If using Rstudio, you can use the “Install” button in the Packages tab, and change the option in the top box (“Install from:”) to “Package Archive File (.zip, .tar.gx)”. This will cause a window to pop up to allow you to select the file you just downloaded.\nAlternatively you can use the command below, substituting the appropriate file path to the .zip or .tar.gz file.\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"path/to/package.zip\", repos = NULL)  # Windows version\ninstall.packages(\"path/to/package.tar.gz\", repos = NULL)  # macOS/Linux version\n\nThis should now proceed just like a regular package installation, though you may need to install additional dependency packages of the package you just installed."
